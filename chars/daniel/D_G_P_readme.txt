About Daniel Gajardo Pulgar:
He's myself in a cartoon style. I drew him when 4 years ago based on Mandy from "The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy". Even though I don't wear that hat, I thought it looked funny. I decided to port him to MUGEN just for lulz this week so my friends (and enemies) would play against me for joking or for hate reasons, be careful with the second one, I will put some boundaries ahead in the readme 8(
He was sprited with MS Paint and I drew him really fast, compare him with my Flash drawings on DeviantArt >=(. He's notoriously a spriteswap of KFM, but soon stuff will be added to him and the difference will start to vanish @_@
