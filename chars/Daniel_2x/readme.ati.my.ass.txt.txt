===================<Daniel MUGEN Character>=====================

Second Major Release thingy. + 0.1 number thingy.

About version: A slight fix in respect to the previous version. This doesn't mean he's completely done but it may be finished later on.

----------What has not been blown to smithereens (what's new)--------------

-Daniel loses the short jump and the power-charge.
-Must hold forward during launcher to combo correctly.
-Got rid of the combo breaker... it was quite.. useless.
-Tennis Racket in air can be done by QCB+K now. No difference in strength with each button (due to it being unpractical).
-Cut down to three level 1 supers (+The burst mode Daniel the Bighead super)
-Finisher doesn't hit instantly now, which was a bad idea to begin with I admit.
-4 powerbars changed to 3 powerbars.
-Due to that, full burst is achieved by 3 powerbars.
-A few other supers bite the dust.
-Some few other things.

----------IN THE LAST MICHAEL BAY MOVIE-------------

-Fixed the limiter to work with some chars with over 1000 life with low or higher defense. Now the limiter is absolute.
-Removed the winscreen.
-Took one of the winposes out.
-I actually removed two supers. Weeeee.
-Adjusted attacks so they have custom get hit behaviours when needed.
-New sprites and animations!
-Given a different sound make up. (From Doug1105's characters)
-Given some details from The "Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy" Game.
-Even more sounds.
-Randomized a ton of stuff.
-Adjusted several details such as the rings on the Master Spark.
-Gave new twists on BURST MODE:
	-Other moves have their behaviour changed, core gameplay is the same, but the attacks vary on speed, timing and comboablity.
-Got rid of some of the debug errors. Half of them is me forgetting that explods can't use floats for pos = x,y
-Mojo Meltdown.
-Added a couple of winposes.
-Added a wallbounce sound.
-Added a ground bounce sound.
-Updated wallbounces to use the diagonal up animation.
-And much more!
-9 DESTINY, Air Strong Punch and Air Strong Kick cannot be comboed into if previous aerial attacks were blocked.
-NOO GAEMPLEI GAMEKS!!1
-LESS CHEEP DAN WLANMINATX
-Optimized more sprites. (Cropped to their bare minimum for the most!)
-Updated Limiter for Many moves.
-Some voices changed.
-Can't parry while dashing in ground.

////====~~~~Character Biography~~~~====////

A lifetime's (well, mostly like 7 years of it) character of mine. He used to look very simple in his older design. Until I drew that picture that is! And decided to change him forever as it was too simple for my increased drawing skills. Afterwards, I had a crisis thinking about making that new design for
MUGEN since it would take (well, I thought it would take) ages to make him again. And the fact of starting from scratch had me in stitches. But I rea-
lized it was not. Period.

-----Story-----

I FORCED DANIEL TO BE HERE, END OF STORY!

-----HIS PERSONALITY-----

...

That pretty much covers him. Have fun!

=======KNOWN ISSUES=======

-Some moves that put you in custom states with custom animations and hitboxes can mess up, sadly, it's because Daniel is a doubleres character and there's NOTHING else I can
do about it, sorry. (Unfixable due to scaling issues (.5 and .5, it must be noted that during custom states where you want the opponent to be hit you better use default
animations.)

-I don't know if this is an issue but he's an idiot. And such he may tend to overjump some good combos.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>GAMEPLAY<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

=======THE SLOT MACHINE=======

It's mainly just a little advantage/disadvantage if you're feeling lucky against easy characters or just if you're desperate with hard chars, you can use anytime. The
AI uses it every time. DERP.

I repeat, you DON'T have to use it unless you want to. Or unless you're the AI, in which case, I pity you.

x+y+z activates it, The effects change with each combination of mugs:

Daniel, Koa, Sheliss = Slow life increase, Maximum Power and 90 Hits on the hit counter! (Unless you already have over 90 hits)
Koax3 = TOTAL Invincibility for about 6 seconds!
Shelissx3 = 25 SECONDS OF BURST! (If they run over though, it counts as running out of the normal burst. SO BE CAREFUL.)
Nickx3 = Auto-Parry for 2.5 seconds.
Lucasx3 = 20 extra Hits to the hit counter!
Cherryx3 = DAMAGE BOOST FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS, The boost is around 33% damage on normal circumstances..
Claricex3 = FULL POWER
Kuromarux3 = Hit counter gets reset to 0 for a couple of seconds!
Shredderx3 = Power Resets to 0 for a couple of seconds.
Utsuhox3 = You get blown up, TRY DODGING THAT LOL!
Danx3 = -15% life (No suicide), 0 Hits and power reset to 0.
Nick, Koa, Sheliss = Daniel gets stunned due to rage for a while, hope you can get beaten up!

NOTES:  -You cannot use the slot machine when getting hit, or when it's grayed out.
	-You lose the chance for a boost if you finish the round.

=======MOVES SO FAR=======

WHOA WHOA WHOA YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY USE HIM!? Hmmm well okay here's how you play as him:

-------Notation-------

x = Weak Punch		a = Weak Kick
y = Medium Punch	b = Medium Kick
z = Heavy Punch		c = Heavy Kick
	   S = Start Button

P = any punch		K = Any kick
2P = Press Two Punch buttons		2K = Press Two Kick Buttons

U = Up
D = Down
B = Back
F = Forward

All moves are in the ground unless stated otherwise!

-----Normal-----

S = Taunt: Just mock your opponent or impress the audience. One of the taunts can be hold if you keep pressing the start button.
	-If you successfully taunt your opponent you win 100 units of power.

>>>Standing<<<

Note y and c do multiple hits, use this for comboing advantage.

>>>Crouching<<<

Everything does what it should, mostly, pay attention to the z attack though, as this is the launcher, which will allow you to pull off combos in an Aereal Rave.

>>>Aerial<<<

Aerial Rave = Kicks can be chained from their respective punch counterpart (for example: x to a) and punches can be chained from a weaker kick, get it? No? Well, don't
look at me and try yourself.

Special notes:
	c bounces the opponent. Opponent is vulnerable to Special attacks, Hyper Attacks, but immune to projectiles.

>>>Throws<<<

These HAVE to be in a close range and they CANNOT be comboed into, unless stated otherwise:

Hold F, z = Serve!: Dan uses his enemy as a tennis ball, and gives them an accurate shot!

Hold F, c = Dizzy Throw: Dan spins rapidly, trapping the enemy inside him and allowing to perform damage to the opponent. Well, until a point he can take anyway.

-----Sub-Par Skills-----

(Hold) F, b = Roll Cheese Cutter: Taking cues from a certain hedgehog, Daniel does a cutter kick, which deals damage in its startup and the first frame of the jump.
	-Landing state can be cancelled into either Standing z or c
	-Lag time is enough for you to miss comboing, but if guarded, get ready to recieve a hit!
	-Can be comboed from x, y, a or b (be it Standing or Crouching)
	-Can be chained to any aerial special.
	-During burst it pushes the opponent so far, it just bounces back at him.

(Hold) B, z = 9 DESTINY: Daniel loses his brain, thinking he's a certain ice fairy.
	-Can be chained into aerial z, c, or "Flying in an Orbit".
	-If aimed correctly it can be used to start combos.

(Hold) B, y = Spin Domination: Daniel steals yet another move from Yuyuko.
	-Can be comboed from x, a or y
	-Can be comboed into every attack that's superior to this.

(In mid-air at any time or while Standing STILL) Tap F before getting hit = Parry:
	-Parry will save you from any hit that's not a throw.
	-Enemies that hit you with attacks that have throw attack attributes WILL HIT!
	-If used wisely in attacks with LOOONGGG animations it's HAPPY COMBO TIME!!!
	-WATCH OUT, if used against projectiles, it may not be as effective as some of them can blow up and still cause damage afterwards.

Tap D before getting hit = Low Parry:
	-Same stuff than before, except this ONLY works for LOW attacks.

x+a = Right through the Flipper: A dodge technique Daniel took days to master.
	-Daniel took ANOTHER bunch of patience to learn to direct his dodge, the direction you're holding directs the dodge:
		·Forward and Back do what they should do.
		·Holding no direction makes the dodge have no direction. 
	-You're invulnerable to almost any attack....
	-...EXCEPT for getting THROWN!
	-You also can get hit on the very last frames of the dodge sliding!! Be careful!!

(Can be done in air) F, F = Forward Run/Dash
	-During burst, the ground forward dash can be cancelled into crouching C.

(Can be done in air) B, B = Backwards Glide

D, U = Super Jump
 
(Three powerbars and less than 33% life)  D, D, Start = BURST!
	-Increases Daniels strenght by 20%
	-Dash and Glide back are faster.
	-EX Moves/Supers can be done by taking out seconds of the burst counter.
	-If Burst ticks to zero, you lose the privilege of having a super bar for the rest of the round.
	-You get only 15 seconds of burst! LESS if you use supers. Use it wisely!
	-EX Moves cost 1 second, Level 1 supers cost 2 seconds, Level 2 supers cost 4 and Level 3 supers cost 8.
	-Using a move that requires more seconds than what you have will trigger no matter what. But burst will time out regardless.

(While Guarding) 2K = YuYuYukancel
	-Takes 0.5 powerbar away
	-Counters enemies while you're guarding.

-----Special Skills-----

General hints: Most of those moves send the opponent into air, allowing for more punishment if done right.

Hint for the n00bs: No, you cannot combo into the same special directly, Unless you send them into something IDK JUST FIND YOUR OWN FUCKING COMBOWZ!!!!!!!

D, DF, F, P = Let'sa Go: Dan Points Luggy the way to the race... abusing the fact that he's lost in the prix.
	-x through z will change speed and damage.
	-Is useful to start air combos, as Daniel's pointing hits too.
	-Luggy always starts from the edge of the screen.
	-Stronger versions are more easy to guard.

D, DB, B, P = Velocity Headbutt: Daniel leans and tries to tackle the opponent with his head.
	-x, y and z versions have more lag the closest to z. That means z has the most lag and x has the least.
	-Daniel travels a short distance except for the Strong version. So if aimed properly you can dash freely with a hitbox in defense.

(Can be done in Air) F, D, DF, P = Fan Whirlpool: Daniel charges a jump, which will result on Daniel pulling his newspaper.
	-x version is the weakest BUT also the fastest and safest.
	-y version travels a little higher and goes for normal damage.
	-z version goes even higher, which is the strongest version of the three, but also the riskiest.
	-All versions' charge can offset Dan's position a little further, in order from x the least to z the most.
	-Invincibility frames on startup.
	-Can be chained from any aerial attack. (Except itself and Flying in an Orbit)

D, DB, B, K = Stuck in 2*pi*radius: Such a weird name, the premise of this move is tennis. Daniel pulls off a tennis racket like the one in his Kick throw, and knocks
it on the opponent's head. Think of it as the scythe of Daniel's older version. However, this time the velocities are fixed so they can lie into supers' range, and not
only that, it's the limiter combo's staple.
	-x version has less lag but it's weaker.
	-y version has medium lag but it's stronger than the x version.
	-z version has a lot of lag so some combos are thrown of this particular one, but it has the biggest oneshot damage.
	-It seems they can cancel projectiles somehow, you may use this as advantage.
	-OVERHEAD MOVE
	-Puts opponent in a custom bounce state, with good timing you can chain into something else!
		*Since everyone seems to not get it, even though I've showcased every combo of his, you can jump towards the opponent and air combo him. That is what I was meaning.

(in Air) D, DB, B, K = Flying in an Orbit: Air version of the previous move.
	-Concerning Fall behaviours, it sends the opponnent flying over the ground after bouncing. Which can be a good follow up to certain moves.
	-It can be chained from the bounce on c. Can be followed up with a super or other moves, just try and do something.

(in Air) Hold D, x = I FELL FOR HOURS!!: An Aerial follow up finisher for slight more damage in these long combos, or a move to stablish pressure.
	-It's a fall down with two parts, the landing, and the falling. The former one does low damage and can even affect lying down people, the falling part
attracts opponents into the landing part and pressures.
	-MOVE'S HIT EFFECT IS NOT INSTANTANEOUS. That means you can fall and not hit.
	-Don't rely much on it. It has a really low priority with NO invincibility. And it can be risky on block.
	-This move bounces the opponent AS HIGH as you hit with it. Try bouncing the opponent at a huge height for easy tornado super grabs!

(Can be done in air) F, D, DF, K = Pounce Surprise!: The only move that seems to remain untouched from the previous Daniel. This move has Daniel flying towards the enemy at different speeds
and Daniel gives a shot to his trusted SMACK trademarked paper once again!
	-x version has the weakest power AND the shortest range, which serves as combo helper!
	-y version has the medium range once again and the medium power, it doesn't seem to be combo friendly.
	-z version has the longest range, but has the INMENSE LAG OF DISTANCE! As well as the biggest damage from all three versions.
	-all three versions of this forward leap have some invincibility at the very start, use to your advantage.
	-THIS MOVE CAN BE CANCELED TO GROUND SUPERS AS LONG AS YOU WAIT FOR DANIEL TO LAND IN THE GROUND!!
	-Strong and Medium Versions can be cancelled into another special move!
	-Because of these, these two versions of the move are REALLY weak.

F, DF, D, DB, B, F, P = The Court finds you Culpirit
	-x and z versions have little hitbox time.
	-y version has the most hitbox time.
	-Z VERSION WHIFFS AGAINST CROUCH BLOCKING! but also travels a little farther
	-Can be followed afterwards by a super jump if aimed correctly!
	-Can only be chained from standing basic attacks and only if they hit.

F, DF, D, DB, B, F, K = This kick is a what the fuck?: Daniel attempts one of his old grab attacks, if successful, Daniel can kick the enemy into the air for more combo
	-Hold forward and Press y at the very start of the move to cut it and recover!
	-Daniel will also fly back in that case
	-If the move connects, it can be cancelled into a jump, to add more into the combo!
	-Can be comboed into.
	-It can grab opponents in the ground or in the air, BUT NOT THOSE WHO ARE FALLING OR LYING DOWN!!

-----EX Skills-----

>>>Pre-requisite: 1/2 of super bar

D, DF, F, 2P = LEXsa Go: EX Version of Let'sa go, it's practically identical to the strong version except it goes by faster.

F, D, DF, 2P = EX Fan Whirlpool: Daniel SMACKS their opponents upwards and then blows them down backwards.
	-Inflicts Ground Bounce.
	-CANNOT BE RECOVERED FROM
	-CANNOT BE DONE IN AIR!

F, D, DF, 2K = EX Pounce Surprise!: Biggest Leap Dan can achieve!
	-This time Daniel deals 3 hits as he leaps!
	-Same supercancel rules from the normal version of this move.

D, DB, B, 2P = EX Headbutt: A really fast headbutt that can backfire, if you know what I mean, it can be followed by an aerial rave too, just press up.

D, DB, B, 2K = EX Stuck in Blah blah blah: Another Aerial rave launcher if hit confirmed.

F, DF, D, DB, B, F, 2P = Suspension Shit Lift: An Ex Grab that if connected can be used to alternatively Aerial Rave.

As you can tell, most of the EX moves are for air combo extension.

-----ASSISTS-----

>>>AHEM, ONLY ONE ASSIST AT A TIME!

-D, D, P = Paralyzing Pandemonium: Kimiya comes out of nowhere and throws a syringe. If it hits opponents get temporairly stunned. 

-D, D, K = Cherry Summon: Cherry comes out of nowhere and does an attack.

-----Level 1 Supers-----

>>>Pre-requisite: 1 super bar

D, DB, B, D, DB, B, K = Loop-dee-loop: This Move has Daniel giving two punches on the same way, and cutting through the enemy in a spin (he won't pass through if
he's too close to the screen boundary though), afterwards, if he did successfully land the attack at least ONCE, he will try and finish off the opponent.
	-If blocked, the finisher will still be executed.
	-Has invincibility frames to hit attacks, except supers. Projectiles and throws will still hit through.
	-Limiter affects the opponent AS SOON as they are touched by this move.

D, DB, B, D, DB, B, P = Dizzy Dance: The best name I could give to the new "Kick Smash" replacer, in this move, Daniel becomes a whirlwind... once again, as he
lunges towards the opponent. If the opponent gets catched he will get sucked in during the pwning. Subject to a lenghty smack of different attacks of his arsenal.
	-This is a Hit or Block attack, if the spin is guarded you have no choice but to take it like a man.
	-Enemies that are here trapped in the move will not get affected by anything outside the move.
	-Total range is mediocre at its best! So aim correctly!!
	-While Daniel spins, unlike Loop-dee-loop, he's immune to projectiles. Use that into advantage.
	-You can STILL follow up with more attacks, just watch the opponent as it... does something kind of amusing.

D, DF, F, DF, D, DB, B, P = DOUBLE FUCKING TEAM ATTACK ACTIVATE: This super move is considerably the longest ranged besides the barrel super.
Daniel tackles the opponent and grabs him, only to have a certain someone assist on the move later.

-----Level 2 Supers-----

>>>Pre-requisite: 2 super bars

D, DF, F, D, DF, F, c = Marisa Charge: Daniel inserted Marisa into the plasma gun charger, which results in a kind of MASTER SPAAAAAAAAARK....
	-Deals 33 hits, airbone opponents DO NOT NECESSARY GET 100% OF THE TOTAL DAMAGE THE MOVE SHOULD DEAL
	-Range is once again SCREENLENGTH, and the attack range is VERY wide.
	-Leaves opponents stuck into the wall for seconds after the final blow, which doesn't make much of a difference as you also get pushed back with no control.
	-Cannot be Dreamcancelled into.

D, DF, F, D, DF, F, c+z = Wall Bounce Powers: Just why.... Y U RIPPING OFF CLARISU
	-The slash can hit, and the slashes can too.

-----Level 3 Supers-----

>>>Pre-requisite: 3 super bars

D, DB, B, D, DB, B, 2P = MOJO SMACKDOWN:  OH SHIT, Shall I mention this is one of the few bashers that actually work against aerial opponents without having them snapped?

-----BURST SUPERS-----

These are moves that the burst mode adds to Daniel's arsenal.

>>>Pre-requisite: Being in burst mode

D, DF, F, DF, D, DB, B, K = DANIEL THE BIGHEAD: Whoa whoa whoa What the fuck. That's supposed to be a Daniel head shaped barrel? What the fuck does he save there?!
	-This move takes a while to actually hit something and arches over everything for small opponents, so aim properly.
	-It's best adviced as a one shot super to add pressure. Also useful against aerial abusers.
	-Holding up before Daniel throws the barrel causes it to point upwards.
	-Takes two seconds away from the burst timer.

F, B, DB, D, DF, F, a = FUGGEN SUSPENSION SHITLIFT AERIAL MOMENTUM... oh god I freaking ran out of names, make your own ok?: Daniel smacks his newspaper pretty much as the
EX Fan Whirlpool, HOWEVER, once the opponent is sent upwards Daniel and... Sabisu out of nowhere; team out to dispose of the opponent skywards.
	-EXTREMELY EASY TO BLOCK.
	-can be Comboed from Basic attacks
	-No more burst upon trigger.

(Full power) D, DB, B, D, DB, B, Start = Cheap Comeback Super:
	-A very powerful super that is to be used as a finisher, should you use it, no more power is allocated to you. But try not to overshoot the damn thing.
		*Jumping over is the best way to get it to fail. Daniel dashes slowly but invulnerable to damage..
			*Either that or just walking away. He doesn't travel a huge distance.
	-No more burst upon trigger.

Yes, you can tell the overall negativity and bad attitude in the character, he's become the equivalent of AVGN these days, doing things not because he wants to but
because he has to.
