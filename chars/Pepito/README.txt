1) faqs

=================================


1. Who the Hell is Pepito? Is he from a cartoon show or something?


   Pepito is a character I created in high school who was one of two main characters in  a comic strip 

I worked on. Before converting him into a M.U.G.E.N character, he starred in my comic strip "Pepito and Juan"

which is about two Mexican-American teenagers growing up in the ghetto who usually banter about 

politics and current events in the most humorous manner (sort of like the Boondocks). Pepito, the politically aware
 
smartass and Juan the usually empty-headed pot-head, are accompanied by a role of supporting characters,like Lupe the radical protester, 

the paletero (ice-cream man), Henry the Magical Hobo, etc., whom most make an appearance as helpers

in this MUGEN character.   





2. What happened to your comic strip?


   Believe it or not, I'm still continuing my Pepito and Juan comic strip over in college in the 

university newspaper. I originally aimed my comic strip for minority audiences during high school, but it seemed 

to be liked by everyone else over in college, which was really a pleasant surprise for me.   





2. What programs did you use?

   
   Flash, photoshop, MS Paint, and MUGEN Editing Ensemble





3. Can you make us a handrawn Neo, Darth Vader, Chuck Norris, etc?


   As much as I enjoyed contributing to the MUGEN community, I will NOT take any suggestions for any 

character, as I realized that working on one is stressful enough. I'm also planning to do all-original

characters only, for now.





4. Aren't you worried about some dildo jackass stealing your original characters?

   
   To be honest, I almost hesitated to go through with mugenizing my own comic strip characters as someone

could steal them, but since I realized that anything I originally make is automatically entitled to copyright,

I could sue any thief trying to claim my characters as I also have my comic strip to give me more ground. I

also knew that I had to come to terms with this situation if I ever create for MUGEN, but this is the risk I'm 

willing to take in order to share my art with the good, honest people in the community.  


      




With the formalities out of the way, let's get this show on the road, shall we?
