====================>Daniel (WINMUGEN only!)<====================
================>Extra Completion Percent Version<================
Started upon: 18/04/2009
Last Update (This one that you've got now): 20/02/2010

====================>Introduction<====================
Thanks for downloading Daniel for your MUGEN, although I wanted the documentation you're reading now to not have any mistake or miss any command or fact, it's inevitable that I might have skipped some part while making the character, so, if Daniel does something that it isn't listed here, e-mail me (daniel9999999@live.cl) or Contact me in other ways and I can tell you why did it happen...
You can also leave comments, bugs, complains, copyright notices?, to my e-mail, as well.

Well, my character currently has up to *20* supers (QUITE EXCESIVE, but actually, the wide variety gives you more room for planning, so you're not likely to use them all in a fight :B, also, I'm not counting the transformations of these supers while in Explosion Moment (see below)), 10 special moves and 5 EX Moves, it has aereal raves

There are some settings hidden at the end of the file "System.st", change them as necesary!!

Finnally my friends, you can change his style from CvS to ANY crap available.

===============>Extra Completion Percent Version Notes<===============

This is a set of various balance changes, bug fixes, additions and several graphical tweaks that have been made to the original character called "Daniel" for exclusive use in MUGEN, these updates are made solely by the author as he's getting bored very quickly in his summer vacation... >_> ALL EXTRA UPDATES COUNT AS OFFICIAL DANIEL UPDATES! The "Extra Version" prefix is appended because these updates are more than what I was dreaming I could get for the Daniel MUGEN character...

====================>Who's Daniel?<====================

Daniel is a 14 years old "teenager", he has a kid's soul though and he can be quite immature in a lot of cimcurstances although he can view consequences of some of his acts and other people's acts, his current Standard Acknowledgement is:

Daniel recieved my full name because of my unisnpired times at 2004 when it came about naming my OCs, he used to be my imaginary self, but he's now replaced by my real self, and Daniel didn't have his name changed because of continuity issues too.

====================>Change Log<====================
Get Comfortable; this list is long... This change log is since the 103% update...

-Aesthetic Fix: New Special Graphic Effects!
-Fixed: Instead of running for a little while in "Watch Minamo's Head", Daniel now jumps with Minamo... WHAMMO!! CRASH!!
-Fixed: Daniel can now combo normal/special attacks into Kick Smash & Punch Smash. Comboability expanded...
-Bug Fix: I "accidentally" had a reference to state 52 (jump land state) within the Standing Strong Punch. Which made Daniel to land earlier if he connected the four hits (RAJAS attack for some people).
-New Material: A "No-KO on SGS" sucess pose added...
-New Material: 2 Explosion Moment Win Poses...
-Aesthetic Fix: Have a Look at Explosion Moment's After Images!
-Aesthetic Fix: ...And Finnally, to remove any visual brokenness, I changed Daniel's Light Kick and Aereal Guard animations so it doesn't look weird anymore!
-Balance Fix: Dizzyfier now only affects ground people...
-Fixed: No Music if Daniel sucessfully wins a round with a HHK...
-Fixed: Limit on Midday Uncharm is no longer existent.
-Fixed: Daniel's Shun Goku Satsu is easier to perform (In Both Modes...)
-Removed: Violet's striker...
-New Material: Added an alternative quote to Daniel's Shuridan, so it doesn't annoy that much...
-Balance Fix: Daniel Steps Back After a SGS, stomper, or a HHK...
-Added: Greatly Expanded Comboability on standing attacks... Mainly the fact that Daniel can now rapid fire a light punch, but damage and hittime on that is reduced...
-Balance Fix: Recharge goes a lil' slower.
-Balance Fix: Aereal Rave finisher cannot target guarding opponents anymore. (Guard States are also movetype = H)
-Changed: Cherry Loses Her Intro, but gains new spriting!
-Balance Fix: Reduced the Dizzyfier's damage even more!
-Added: Daniel CAN'T get pwned by F1! AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT TOUCH F1, I still have to implement a reversal that reverses reversals... >_>
-New Material: "You are a F***ing Faker!" Intro.
-Removed: Some quotes, sounds and music that went unused.
-Balance Fix: RRDA: Moved HitDef from Falling with Truck state into fly attempt state so the move can be guarded easier (and so I can get hitdefpersist into use! :D), range reduced.
-Fixed: AI will trigger up to 3x faster as the AI commands were changed from 10 to 30. (To tell whether the AI is on, check if Daniel is recharging, if he isn't, the AI is on)
-Balance Fix: Daniel now recharges faster in order to keep him balanced against several characters (Warusaki3's, Choujin's OR EVEN Haruhi for example), BUT 3000 IS STILL THE LIMIT! The charge goes from small power chunks up to massive power overload, thus, the charge will depend on how often you are forced to end the power charge (whether getting hit or releasing y+b)
-Changed: Daniel's Road Roller Da behaves more like the crowd's favorite...
-Aesthetic Fix: Made Super Sparks to fade to Black in super attacks that have overlapping Sparks.
-Balance Fix: Covered up CLNS1 for aereal attacks.
-Fixed: Kick Smash now correctly pummels characters with small dizzy animations! (Some Touhou characters had it like that) In addition, I reduced the guard pause time from 12 to 6, plus I reduced as well the hit pause of this move in Explosion Moment.
-Re-Added: Previous CvS2 Effect is Back!! NO MORE CROPPED SUPER SPARKS!!! HECK YEAAAAAAAHH YEAAAAAHH!!
-Balance Fix: Reduced the light punches and light kicks' power adds...
-Changed: Roll can be made at any time now, however, you cannot control the roll direction anymore. Note that you are vulnerable to throws while rolling...
-Changed: Score system is now OFF by default, you can change this by editing "System.st", looking for the last State Controller (It's at the end of the file) and changing the very last 0 to 1
-Remotion: His old snd file ("daniel.snd"), unused data and the (now) old CvS 2 Super Start Spark, which further reduced the folder size to 16.9 MB! (Less than 11 MB compressed) which greatly reduces download time (and uploading time too! :D).
-Bug Fix: Forgot that animation action 5061 is optional... (Fixes possible p2 animation glitches with Cherry Bash and Newspaper Home-Run Beatdown)
-Changed: Sprites, Animations & Voices have been changed! In addition, Daniel has some different animations while in Explosion Moment!! Not all of them were overriden because it could make the entire character ugly in Explosion Moment, and he looks good enough with his main stances...
-Bug Fix: When Daniel is AI controlled, he could cancel ANYTHING into his Midday Uncharm... which could make (and actually made) the other player to get stuck!! 8o (Forgot to include "trigger5 = ctrl" on AI)
-Bug Fix: Kick Smash could have a weird behavement on Explosion Moment if the last hit was connected to p2 while he had a non-zero vertical speed.
-Changed: U. N. Gajardo Was Him? Super Move was removed to give Daniel an even more dangerous super! The Midday Uncharm!
-Changed: HHK's command changed from three Quarter Circles Back + z to QCB, HCF + z because sometimes you want to do a "Road Roller Da" but you screw up the command or you do four QCB's to be sure that the move will work, and MUGEN detects three of these as if you did a HHK... Similar case when you want a HHK but you mess up and do a RRDa..
-Sound Change: "99... Crack Fist... Plus Car!" quote changed to "100... CRACK FIST!", I put the former one because I wanted to tweak the final HHK Kick into a Car Land... But I didn't somehow...
-Bug Fix: If you tapped the up button to do a low jump, and if you were running, Daniel didn't jump at all, meaning he could cancel his run. 
-Explosion Moment Change: CvS Parry threshold time is 15 ticks while in Explosion Moment, in Normal mode, the Parry Override lasts for 8 ticks.
-Misc. Change: Explosion Moment Gets turned off as soon as the opponent(s) is/are KOed. As Daniel Has not any E. M. Win Poses yet...
-AI Bug Fix: Daniel could trigger an explosion moment while he was airbone.
-Changed: New Super Charge Sound.
-Addition: Remember Haruhi's Variable Jump? Guess who now has this!!! (It required some little adaptation, though...)
-Audio Change: Daniel's Voice Triggers have been moved from State -1 to State -2 and changed channel of audio flow to channel 0.
-Remotion: That weird throw's now finally, surely, without a doubt and successfully GONE and obliterated!!! 8D (This time for real, since I deleted its codes and its AI triggers)
-Addition: Daniel now has a new Explosion Moment super, taught by TuffTony!
-Misc. Change: Disclaimer is now more strict about what you can do and what you cannot with this character.
-Misc. Change: New jokes inside this readme.
-AI Change: Daniel stops using Level 1 supers when he has more than 1750 power. Stops using Level 2 supers if he has more or equal than 2600 power. And always uses either Level 3 or Level 4 when available.
-Fixed: Angry Daniel's Hits now have a 75% of extra chance to hit the opponent with all the hits...
-Changed: Changed E.M. Command from D, D, x to D, D, Start. The reason for this is that you could screw a Kick Smash with an Explosion Moment as you don't always hit the x+y/x+z buttons at the same time.
-Compatibility Change: Anim 15212 has been removed; this anim is Choiyer's Haruhi Molester Grab special target anim. Removed because it doesn't fit anymore... (It's not funny anymore)
-Compatibility Change: Electrocuted/Shocked animation is no longer a burnt Daniel, it now has its own sprites and follows the classic cartoonage.
-Balance Fix: CLNS 1 in the Hyper Kicker Move are all covered up!!.
-Balance Fix: Hyper Slap's Damage has been reduced to 300 with a guard damage of 2, this is because the range is global... :P Also, the move is now perfectly blockable as the attack's no longer instantaneous...
-Balance Fix: The Slide time for E.M. Run Forward (State 10100) and velocity were increased so Daniel doesn't get hit as soon as P2 Recovers. Damage for This "move" has been decreased.
-Balance Fix: Forgot to put the guardflags on Violet Striker... >_<
-Bug Fix: Stand/Crouch Parry glitched if Hit Override was still active while you were airbone.
-Bug Fix: When the Cherry Strikers were hit and they were hit-paused, it could create a Daniel Clone, which, of course gets deleted as soon as it reached State 0 (standing state).
-Changed: Explosion Moment now cuts life by half. Getting 4000 power was difficult to do at that time, plus the risks of doing it are more pronounced... :B
-Addition: An unshaded pallete.
-Changed: Some hard to do commands have been changed.
-Added: A new kind of throw in explosion moment and in simul fights, but takes YOUR TEAM-MATE (if any), and throws him to the opponent!! (And deals damage to both your opponent and your teammate)
-Balance Fix: Let's Parody Iori has been changed as an explosion moment super, in addition, Daniel no longer has control while stunned by fire! BUT HE IS INVULNERABLE during the burnt Time...
-Balance Fix: Explosion Moment ATK & DEF Boost changed from 33% to 20%
-AI Change: Daniel's now more aggresive and smarter. Specially when in explosion moment!
-Bug Fix: In simul fights, if you killed one of the opponents with a Road Roller Da but the other was still alive, the win pose was still being triggered, producing a glitchy result...
-Bug Fix: in simul fights, the HHK could hit both opponents.

-The Velocity at which Daniel rockets out is twice as of now.

-F, B, DB, D, DF, F, B, F, a/64123646a: Super Death: Only in Explosion Moment; Inexplicabily Daniel creates a light stunning explosion, miss it and bye bye power bar, use with care, it hits all allies and enemies.

-RETARDED MUGEN CHARS KIND OF SITES, DANIEL'S NOT (All that) RETARDED, HE'S JUST SPECIAL (LOL! "The doctor called me special!!" XD)... >_>

====================>Misc Data<====================

-NEVER PUT MORE OR LESS THAN SEVEN "9"s AS MY USER HANDLE. GOD, WHY CAN'T YOU REMEMBER JUST SEVEN NINES... >_> HUMANS ARE ABLE TO MEMORIZE UP TO TEN DIGITS IN A ROW...

-If you showcase these Daniel updates in a YT Video and such, please take your time to copy & paste the "Change Log" section of this readme to the video description and the link to the character. This makes the new Daniel updates to become famous (or unfamous, whatever).

-"Nientiendo" is a humorous copyright replacement for Nintendo, which is a pun made of the words "Ni" and "Entiendo", which, together in a sentence, says "Ni Entiendo", which means "I don't understand it neither"...

-Daniel is being candidate for the Biggest MUGEN Character Collaboration with a total of 8 people that contributed to the character! (We got you! Homer!)

-Some characters that Daniel can team up with excellently are Homer Simpson, Haruhi Suzumiya, Tim, Dooby Dummy, Mr. Satan, Sman, Pivot Stickman and, of course, Himself!
