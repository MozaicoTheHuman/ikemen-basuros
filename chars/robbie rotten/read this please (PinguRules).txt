====================================================
So this thing is a spriteswap of a mediocre character
and the CLSNs are more messed up than Josh Geary
I had to get this thing fixed and balanced
Many flaws are still present, but the most demanding ones are gone

I also added a few moves and a English voicepack with voices taken from the music videos


Sportacus and Lazytown citizens move to MUGEN for vacation to watch and participate in the tournament.
Seeing everyone so active triggered Robbie Rotten like a tumblr SJW,
and he became determined to knock everyone so silly
so they'll have no choice but to recuperate and therefore not move, becoming lazy.

...That's the best story I can think of...\

====================================================
=============The big fat movelist page==============
====================================================

Specials:

v > kick = Sugar Apple (the one that knocked Sportacus out, I believe)

No damage, but the main use for it is to reduce opponents' power, and allow yourself to get into a combo.
As what Robbie Rotten calls it, a "sugar meltdown". Made with the Candy Faker Maker 3000.

v < kick = Lair Lever

Has a long windup time, but you're very safe when you use this move. This is a torture to program.

< (for a while) > x = Cake
< (for a while) > y = Cake with a shocker
< (for a while) > x+y = Cake with explosives

Robbie Rotten's favourite food. He'll eat cake with sand in it without second thoughts.

Supers (1000 power):

v > 2punch = Junk Food

Generic DC Template super.

v < 2punch = Disguise as Sportacus

Sportacus loves moving...right?

v > 2kick = Diabetes

I mean like seriously

v < 2kick = Disguise as T Rex

"Don't let your children watch it!"

Supers (3000 power): ;to be implemented

< > < > 2punch = You are a Pirate

Inspiration from a certain terrible character made from a certain terrible author...

< > < > 2kick = Cannon Fire

"shoot him out of town like a circus clown" indeed.

====================================================
======================Q and A=======================
====================================================

Q: What is this "configuration" file?
A: This lets you change a few things about Robbie without having to know any coding experience prior!
   Just open it and do what it tells you to, and you should be fine.

Q: I heard Stefan has cancer! I want to donate, where can I help?!
A: Good news, he's CURED of cancer and now he needs the money to recover and heal, the original goal was 50k
   but it was raised to 75k, then 100k to enourage more donations. Nevertheless, donators prevailed and now it's over
   100,000!!!111!!11

Q: What 100,000?! There's no way that could be right!
A: See for yourself:
   Donate if you want to. I recommend doing so. :)

Q: Did you donate?
A: Not old enough to :(

Q: OMG NOT ENOUGH MAY MAYS!
A: This Robbie isn't supposed to be based off only the We are Number One music video, there are other things there too.

Q: WHY ARE THE CLSNS SO FOKING CRAZILY OFF U HALFBUTTING CANT?!?!???!?!?!?!!/11/1 raeg!!1111
A: I guess you could say I was...lazy. LOLOLOOLLOLOLOL-*shot*
   In all seriousness, I *detest* CLSNs and I can't be bothered to do it, so I just made one CLSN box
   and made sure it's approximately covering most of the parts in one section so it would work fair enough.
   If you want to update the CLSNs, please do. I would appreciate it. (Some like the cannon and the ship are intended tho)

Q: Thanks
A: You're welcome

Q: I came from FourthRhyme's channel since I saw your comment, and I prefer him and his memes though
A: I hate you, please die in the most painful way imaginable





   ...jk lol it's cool, each to their own, i'm not offended
