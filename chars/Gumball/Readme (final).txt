1. Introduction

Hey, it's been a long time! I'm MGSSJ2, some of you people may know me as a coder who mostly focuses on doing small, diverse characters. Well, I'm back now, and I've decided to begin editing normal sized characters, which I think I might make even better using all the things I learnt about coding. This is my first attemp at a normal character edit, and I hope you all like it.
You're now staring at an edit of Cattigan619's Gumball Watterson, from the The Amazing World of Gumball TV series. Cattigan's sprites are the best ones on the net, and I lately got a lot into the Gumball series, so I decided to find the best Gumball out there and boost it up to greater coding levels. Since these sprites are so good, I started editing it like a month ago, and this was the final result: an almost new character, with lots of added content, lots of fixed content, and some little secrets you might want to find out :)
On to the character!


2. Details

This Gumball is meant to work ONLY FOR MUGEN 1.0., and only in the native resolution.
It will work in 1.1, HOWEVER most of his portraits and background effects will mess up in size (if someone knows of a way to scale Helpers according to the zoom, please let me know). I'd have switched to 1.1 before, but I feel most people still play 1.0, but whatever...


3. Movelist

The style of the character is slighty based from the Marvel vs Capcom style characters. Weak, medium, and strong punchs and kicks are x,y,z and a,b,c respectively. You can launch characters up in the air with the Strong Crouching Punch, then jump and connect an aerial combo. It's easy to do and it takes a good amount of damage away, but it might be hard to connect.
On to the special moves. All of them vary in certain way depending on the strength of the key you use. Keep that in mind.

Special moves:
- Hadouken: QCF+any punch.
	Your simple everyday Hadouken. BIG HEAD.
- Shoryuken: F,D,DF+any punch.
	Your simple everday Shoryuken too.
- Headbutt: QCB+any punch.
	Gumball gives impulse to himself and charges forward. It's a chargable attack, so you can hold it up to gain some power.
- The Anaihilator: QCF+any kick.
	IT'S THE ANAIHILATOR! Anais will connect some hits if you pull this one out, but it won't work if you're too close to your 	opponent!
- Clayzooka: QCB+any kick.
	Gumball will pull out Clayton and shoot him in his bazooka form. A quick projectile to pull when your opponent is too far (or 	too close).
- Throw: any 2 punches.
	A simple throw. Not much to say, I guess?

Level 1 Hyper attacks:
- Rapid Paintball Shots: QCF x+y.
	Gumball will shot a quick barrage of paintball shots in random directions.
- Karate Barrage: QCB b+c
	The Karate Wieners have returned! Some quick hits and a final jumping kick to throw the opponent away.
- Konami Code: QCB x+y
	A little creative work I did here. Gumball tries to use cheat codes in real life and... well, it did some damage, didn't it?
- Gumball Dash Masher (?): QCF y+z
	A tribute to an old character in the Mugen community. If you manage to get the
	opponent, then Gumball will nail some punches and kicks on him.

Level 2 Hyper attacks:
- Shinku Hadouken: QCF a+b
	A barrage of insults that turns into a big Hadouken. An easy way to do some damage.
- Shin Shoryuken: QCB a+b
	Another barrage of insults, this time turning into a big Shoryuken. Gumball will dash into his opponent to do this one, so it
	is also good if you're too far and you want to surprise him.
- Darwin Assist: QCF b+c
	Gumball calls for Darwin to get help in battle. Big head!
- Carrie Posession: QCB y+z
	Carrie appears and posesses Gumball, turning him into a deadly fighter for some seconds. If it manages to hit, it can do some 	serious damage.

Level 3 Hyper attacks:
- Ultimate Combo: QCF a+b+c.
	Gumball gets angry and starts gathering power, only to release it into a deadly combination of punches, kicks and insults. 		This is unblockable and it's easy to kill the opponent with it, but it will only hit opponents in the ground and you have 	only one shot. Handle with care!


4. Credits and final words
I'd like to thank the following people:
- First, thanks to Cattigan619 for doing these awesome Gumball sprites. Also he helped me by sending me some sprites he had for unimplemented stuff, so the char could be as complete as possible. Thanks dude, I hope you like what I did to your character :)
- Second, thanks to MattFV for some help with the sprites, even though we couldn't implement everything we wanted, the char still turned out really ok. If I ever do another version, I'll be sure to call you again :)
- Thanks to all the people at MFFA chat who helped me with feedback and testing, especially to DartzPie and Witch.
- Thanks to all the original creators/rippers of all the effects and sounds I borrowed from other characters. 
- Thanks to Ben Bocquelet and the Cartoon Network team for creating this awesome television series. With all the horrible cartoons currently on TV, I'm happy to know there is still something worth watching :)
- And finally, thanks to you, for downloading this character and reading this until the end. I hope you like this, I put several hours of effort into making this as high quality as possible.

Well, that's all for now. If you want to keep up with the stuff I do, feel free to follow me on Youtube. I don't do many videos, but any of my future releases will be featured there.
