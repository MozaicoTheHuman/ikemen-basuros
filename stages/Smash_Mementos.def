 ;High is a negative number. Make is more negative if you want to

 ;If omitted, defaults to -25 and 0 respectively
 ;***
boundlow = 0

 ;This is how much the camera will move vertically towards the
 ;highest player. Valid values are from 0 to 1. A value of 0 will mean
 ;the camera does not move up at all. A value of 1 will makes the camera
 ;follow the highest player.
 ;Typically .2 for normal-sized backgrounds. You may need to pull this
 ;value up for taller backgrounds.
verticalfollow = .95

 ;Minimum vertical distance the highest player has to be from the floor,
 ;before the camera starts to move up to follow him. For extremely
 ;tall stages, a floor tension of about 20-30 coupled with a
 ;vertical-follow of .8 allows the camera to follow the action.

 ;result.

 ;Defaults to 0.4 if omitted.
yscale = .03

 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
 ;the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the
 ;ground. If omitted, defaults to no level effects (shadow is

 ;blank if you don't want music. If an invalid filename is
 ;given, then no music will play. To play CD audio, put
 ;the track number followed by ".da". Using a track number of
 ;0 will play a random audio track. For example, to play
 ;track 3 from a music CD, use:
 ;  bgmusic = 3.da

 ;because it slows down performance.
debugbg = 0


;----------
; Start each background element with the following:
; Make sure it's "[BG n]", where n is anything you like (it's only used to
; report errors.) For example, you could use:  [BG TheFloor]
; Specify as many as you like. This is an example of a normal background:
[BG 0]

 ;The background type goes here: for now, only NORMAL and PARALLAX
 ;If this line is omitted, the type will be assumed to be normal.

 ;The sprite number to use for the background (from the SFF specified above)
 ;It's the group-number, followed by a comma, then the sprite-number
 ;*** Do not omit this line.
spriteno = 0, 0

 ;This is the layer number, which determines where the sprite is drawn to.
 ;Valid values are 0 and 1.
 ;0 for background (behind characters), 1 for foreground (in front)
 ;If this line is omitted, the default value of 0 will be assumed.
layerno = 0

 ;This is the starting location of the background in the format
 ;x, y
 ;If this line is omitted, the default value of 0,0 will be assumed.
start = 0, 0

 ;These are the number of pixels the background moves for every single unit
 ;of camera movement, in the format
 ;x, y
 ;For the main background (eg. the floor the players stand on) you'll want
 ;to use a delta of 1,1. Things farther away should have a smaller delta,
 ;like 0.5 for example. Things near the camera should have a larget delta.
 ;If this line is omitted, the default value of 1,1 will be assumed.
delta = .75, .75

 ;Here is the transparency setting of the background.
 ;Valid values are:
 ;"none" for normal drawing
 ;"add" for colour addition (like a spotlight effect)
 ;"add1" for colour addition with background dimmed to 50% brightness
 ;"addalpha" for colour addition with control over alpha values (you need
 ;    an "alpha" parameter if you use this)
 ;"sub" for colour subtraction (like a shadow effect)
 ;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no transparency.
trans = none

 ;Use this parameter only if "trans = addalpha". First value is the alpha
 ;of the source (sprite), and the second is the alpha of the destination
 ;(background). The values range from 0 to 256.
 ;Uncomment the line below to use it:
;alpha = 256,0

 ;Mask means whether or not to draw colour zero of a sprite.
 ;If you turn masking off, the background will take less CPU power to draw,
 ;so remember to turn it off on sprites that don't use it.
 ;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no masking.
mask  = 0

 ;The format for tiling is x,y. For each of them, the value is:
 ;0 to use no tiling, 1 to tile, n where (n>1) to tile n times.
 ;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no tiling.
;tile  = 0, 0

 ;This is the x and y space between each tile, for tiled backgrounds
 ;If omitted, default value is 0,0
tilespacing = 0,0

 ;This defines the drawing space, or "window" of the background. It's
 ;given in the form
 ;x1,y1, x2,y2
 ;where (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) define a rectangular box.
 ;Make the window smaller if you only want to draw part of the background.
 ;You normally do not have to change this setting. Value values range from
 ;0-319 for x, and 0-239 for y. The values are 0,0, 319,239 by default (full
 ;screen).
 ;Uncomment the line below to use it:
;window = 0,0, 1279, 719

 ;Similar to the delta parameter, this one affects the movement of
 ;the window. Defaults to 0,0
 ;Uncomment the line below to use it:
