[Shadow]
 ;This is the shadow darkening intensity. Valid values range from
 ;0 (lightest) to 256 (darkest). Defaults to 128 if omitted.
intensity = 0

 ;This is the shadow color given in r,g,b. Valid values for each
 ;range from 0 (lightest) to 255 (darkest).
 ;Defaults to 0,0,0 if omitted.
 ;intensity and color's effects add up to give the final shadow
 ;result.
color = 0,0,0

 ;This is the scale factor of the shadow. Use a big scale factor
 ;to make the shadow longer. You can use a NEGATIVE scale factor
 ;to make the shadow fall INTO the screen.
 ;Defaults to 0.4 if omitted.
yscale = .03

 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
 ;the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the
 ;ground. If omitted, defaults to no level effects (shadow is
 ;always fully visible).
fade.range = 0,0

[Reflection]
 ;Intensity of reflection (from 0 to 256). Set to 0 to have no
 ;reflection. Defaults to 0.
intensity = 100

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Music]
 ;Put a filename for a MOD, MP3 or MIDI here, or just leave it
 ;blank if you don't want music. If an invalid filename is
 ;given, then no music will play. To play CD audio, put
 ;the track number followed by ".da". Using a track number of
 ;0 will play a random audio track. For example, to play
 ;track 3 from a music CD, use:
 ;  bgmusic = 3.da
bgmusic = sound\targetpractice.mp3

 ;Adjust the volume. 100 is for 100%.
bgmvolume = 255
